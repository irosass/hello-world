# hello-world
My very first repository
 
I am writing a little bit about myself :O)
I like to write API specs, learn on how to implement slim code and to integrate Server and Client side using RESTFul Endpoints.
I also like tacos, but I must say that Mexican Tacos must be much better that the ones in the moon.
